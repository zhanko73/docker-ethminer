### Requirements
- Nvidia drivers for your GPU, you can get them here: [Nvidia drivers](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)
- Nvidia-docker (so docker can access your GPU) install instructions here: [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)

### How to run
```
$ nvidia-docker run -it anthonytatowicz/eth-cuda-miner ARG1 ARG2 ...

# Example
$ nvidia-docker run -it anthonytatowicz/eth-cuda-miner \
-S us-west1.nanopool.org:9999 \
-O <your_wallet_address>.<worker_name>/<your_email>
```

**Note:** `-U` is set by default

**Note:** Be sure to change the -O argument to your mining address and email.
